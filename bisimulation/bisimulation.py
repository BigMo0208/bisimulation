#Hello Professor Moss,

#I have recently studied the anti-foundation axiom and came across your Stanford encyclopedia article. To gain a deeper understanding off bisimulations and quotient graphs I attempted to reproduce the bisimulation from the article using an open source implementation of the algorithm (https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03519). However the generated bisimulation only has two equivalence classes. (https://github.com/BigMo0208/bispy-test)

#Is the bisimulation used in non well-founded set theory different to the bisimulations from graph/automata theory?


#As a self taught mathematician any clarification or insight you could provide on this topic would greatly help me develop a deeper understanding of Your theory and its applications.
#I thank You in advance for your time and valuable insights. Your work has deeply inspired me and I look forward to learning more about it.


#Dear Moritz Ackermann,

#The bisimulation used in non well-founded set theory is basically the same as the bisimulation from graph/automata theory: one takes a set T (usually a transitive set), and turns it into a graph by the definition 

 #  x --> y  if and only if y is an element of x

#Then one applies the definition of bisimulation from graphs/automata.

#I haven't looked at your github link, but I have an idea that could clarify things for you.  There is a difference between a bisimulation and the largest bisimulation. Perhaps this is old news to you, but the largest bisumulation on a given graph is the union of all the bisumulations on it.  But there are many bisimulations on a given graph â€“ for example, the empty relation would be one.  My guess is that the implementation that you were using computed the largest one (since this is the main one of interest in practice).   

#Does this help?
